# Project Tasks

This document outlines the four core tasks for the feasibility study. Each task is assigned to a hypothetical student role.

## Task 1: Geological Survey
**Assigned to:** student-geologist  
**Description:** Research and document the typical lithology, alteration, and gold mineralization found in the Wadi Allaqi region. Create a report at `docs/geological_report.md`.  
**Deliverable:** Markdown report summarizing geological characteristics.

## Task 2: Mining & Processing Plan
**Assigned to:** student-engineer  
**Description:** Propose a suitable open-pit mining method and a simple processing flow sheet (e.g., crushing, grinding, gravity separation) for low-grade gold ore. Create a diagram and description in `docs/processing_plan.md`.  
**Deliverable:** Document with mining method description and flow sheet diagram.

## Task 3: Economic Analysis
**Assigned to:** student-economist  
**Description:** Develop a 10-year preliminary cash flow model using the `economic_model/cash_flow_analysis.xlsx` file. Include assumptions for capital expenditure, operating costs, gold price, and ore grade.  
**Deliverable:** Excel spreadsheet with cash flow projections.

## Task 4: Policy & Investment
**Assigned to:** student-policy-analyst  
**Description:** Analyze the key articles of Egyptian Mining Law No. 195/2018 that relate to foreign investment and royalty payments. Summarize the potential economic impact on the project in `docs/policy_summary.md`.  
**Deliverable:** Policy summary report.

## Workflow
1. Each student creates a branch named after their task (e.g., `branch/geological-survey`).
2. They work on their assigned task and commit changes to that branch.
3. They open a pull request referencing the corresponding issue (once issues are created).
4. After review, the pull request is merged into `main`.

*Note: GitHub Issues will be created separately to track each task.*
