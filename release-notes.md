## Contents
- Repository structure with `docs/`, `data/`, and `economic_model/` directories.
- README.md with project objective, description, deliverables, and contributing guidelines.
- tasks.md detailing the four core tasks and student assignments.
- Placeholder files for reports and cash flow analysis.
