# Egyptian Gold Feasibility Study

## Objective
This repository contains a semester-long collaborative project for a group of university students. The goal is to conduct a preliminary feasibility study for a hypothetical open-pit gold mine in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, specifically in the Wadi Allaqi region.

## Project Description
The hypothetical mine is located in the Wadi Allaqi region, known for its gold mineralization. The study will cover geological assessment, mining and processing methods, economic analysis, and policy considerations.

## Deliverables
1. Geological survey report documenting lithology, alteration, and gold mineralization in Wadi Allaqi.
2. Mining and processing plan with a suitable open-pit method and flow sheet.
3. Economic analysis with a 10-year cash flow model.
4. Policy summary analyzing Egyptian Mining Law No. 195/2018 and its impact on the project.

## Contributing
To contribute to this project, follow these steps:

1. Each student is assigned a specific issue (Geological Survey, Mining & Processing Plan, Economic Analysis, Policy & Investment).
2. Create a new branch from `main` for your assigned issue (e.g., `branch/geological-survey`).
3. Complete your work and commit your changes to your branch.
4. Open a Pull Request (PR) to merge your branch into `main`. Title the PR to correspond with the issue number (e.g., "PR for Issue #1: Geological Survey Report").
5. In the PR description, link to the issue you are closing using the keyword "Closes #X".

## Repository Structure
- `docs/`: Directory for final reports.
- `data/`: Directory for any data collected during the study.
- `economic_model/`: Directory containing the cash flow analysis spreadsheet.
