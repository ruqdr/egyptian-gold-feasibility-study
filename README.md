# Egyptian Gold Feasibility Study

## Objective
This repository contains a semester-long collaborative project for a group of university students. The goal is to conduct a preliminary feasibility study for a hypothetical open-pit gold mine in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, specifically in the Wadi Allaqi region.

## Project Description
The hypothetical mine is located in the Wadi Allaqi region, known for its gold mineralization. The study will cover geological assessment, mining and processing methods, economic analysis, and policy considerations.

## Deliverables
1. Geological survey report documenting lithology, alteration, and gold mineralization in Wadi Allaqi.
2. Mining and processing plan with a suitable open-pit method and flow sheet.
3. Economic analysis with a 10-year cash flow model.
4. Policy summary analyzing Egyptian Mining Law No. 195/2018 and its impact on the project.

## Project Tasks
Detailed task descriptions and student assignments are available in [tasks.md](tasks.md). The project is divided into four core tasks:

1. **Geological Survey** – assigned to student-geologist
2. **Mining & Processing Plan** – assigned to student-engineer
3. **Economic Analysis** – assigned to student-economist
4. **Policy & Investment** – assigned to student-policy-analyst

Each task corresponds to a GitHub Issue (to be created). Students should refer to the issue for specific instructions.

## Contributing
To contribute to this project, follow these steps:

1. Each student is assigned a specific task (Geological Survey, Mining & Processing Plan, Economic Analysis, Policy & Investment).
2. Create a new branch from `main` for your assigned task (e.g., `branch/geological-survey`).
3. Complete your work and commit your changes to your branch.
4. Open a Pull Request (PR) to merge your branch into `main`. Title the PR to correspond with the issue number (e.g., "PR for Issue #1: Geological Survey Report").
5. In the PR description, link to the issue you are closing using the keyword "Closes #X".
